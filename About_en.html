                From a young age, it has been an honor to be able to share the joys and sorrows with the people.
                Then there was a spark to help others and solve problems.
                Now being a psychotherapist is a continuation of this desirable desire.
                Actually solving difficult situations and puzzles is empowering and more dear a hobby like a bread job.

                As a young man, the road took me to study shipping but, due to poor work conditions, getting a job at a
                hospital
                felt natural.
                Initially, some time went by in the care of the elderly until army time cut off working life.
                Work with the elderly continued after the army and was followed by an application to study
                a registered nurse.
                Specializing in Internal Medicine Surgical Nursing was actually an injury.
                Even during my studies, working with psychiatry seemed like the best thing to do.
                Many different hospitals and departments were visited during and after graduation.
                However, most with acute psychiatry.
                The long employment in the crisis unit and the specialization in psychiatric care was the moment when
                woke up to the dream of studying to become a psychotherapist sometime.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the other hand, shipping that has been a tradition for centuries,
                the seas also demanded a revision of that road.
                Years passed in the field of acute psychiatry, with most of the closed wards until the urge to try
                ship work also grew so large that it led to further maritime studies.
                The officer's degree came and I did a lot of work at the same time; on ships and
                hospitals.
                After graduation, she spent many years in ship work.
                First on deck, then later as a passenger ship nurse and occupational health nurse.
                This work was greatly assisted by my experience in psychiatric nursing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Along with the job, there was an opportunity to study as a psychotherapist.
                It really came to a good point.
                Previously, there had been the idea that it would be closer to retirement age with the goal of making
                it.
                In 2009, the history of DanCan began.
                Boat work made it possible for part-time psychotherapy, thanks to the long vacations
                work guidance was easy to do in a reasonable amount.
                The aim is to start a full-time job in psychotherapy, counseling and education.
            </p>
            <p>
                During my working life I have done a lot of work therapy and met with such individuals, couples, entire
                families as well as work communities.
                In the mid-1990s, getting to know solution-oriented methods of help opened up one's own idea
                problem solving and gave a whole new perspective on how to handle situations that were
                seemed particularly challenging when approached with more traditional frameworks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today I have my own main goal in client work, that of getting help from the client.
                When he leaves the reception, I want him to have a new perspective on his problem, something concrete
                and how to go about it.
                In addition, it is important that he feels relieved.
                The actual purpose of the care is always created in cooperation with the client and it is the care
                the most important thing.
